A software ray tracer built upon the foundations of the Ray Tracing in One Weekend book series.

The project was extended beyond the book series through the introduction of multithreading using std::async. This alone decreased the render time bu 88%.

Features of this ray tracer include:
- materials with properties which determine how rays should be reflected/refracted
- antialiasing with MSAA
- depth of field
